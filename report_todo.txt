SSIM similarities for ResNet18:
- not clear how to normalize saliency maps before comparing them with SSIM
  - using captum's own normalize method (from captum.attr._utils.visualization import _normalize_image_attr):
    - results dissimilar to those of the paper with Inception v3
  - using no normalization (raw saliency maps, values very small)
  - try their normalization (squash values to [0, 1]-interval)

- our CNN for MNIST has the same architecture as theirs
- tried out IntegratedGradients with smoothing, but it crashed our kernel
- some issues with IntegratedGradients:
  -
- some issues with GuidedBackprop:
  - use of deprecated function by captum with ReLU (settings backward hooks)
  - returns very different results sometimes
