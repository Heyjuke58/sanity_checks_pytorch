# Sanity Checks for Saliency Methods

In this repo we reimplement a sanity check (cascading randomization) for numerous saliency methods. We let us guide by a paper from [Adebayo et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03292) and their code (https://github.com/adebayoj/sanity_checks_saliency)

We examine the sanity check using a basic CNN trained on MNIST as well as a pre-trained ResNet-18 on ImageNet. You can find our detailed results in the PDF file.
